### Why 40% of Automotive Suppliers Fail TISAX on First Attempt
The transition to **VDA ISA 5.0** has raised the bar for physical security, prototype protection, and supply chain transparency. Many suppliers fail not because they lack security, but because they lack the *auditable evidence* required for an AL3 label.

### Our Automotive Service Suite:
- **TISAX® Readiness Assessment (AL2 & AL3):** We conduct a full mock audit, map all 140+ controls, and remediate gaps in your ISMS.
- **ISO 21434 TARA Implementation:** Engineering-focused cybersecurity for vehicle type approval.
- **TPISR Compliance (Auto-ISAC):** Navigating the specific requirements of North American OEMs (Ford, GM).

## PROOF POINTS:
- **100% First-Time Pass Rate:** Our methodologies are developed by auditors, for suppliers.
- **Tier-1 Specialist:** We understand the pressure of OEM production deadlines.
- **Multi-Site Scoping:** Expert guidance on ENX portal registration and scoping for international production sites.

## OBJECTION HANDLING:
1. "It's too expensive." -> *Correction:* "A failed audit costs 5x more in lost revenue and audit re-takes. We optimize for high-impact, low-cost remediation."
2. "We have no time." -> *Correction:* "Our accelerated 95-day roadmap is designed for emergency contract compliance."
