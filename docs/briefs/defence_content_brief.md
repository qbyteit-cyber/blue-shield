### The New Standard of Defence Compliance
With the finalization of **CMMC 2.0**, every organization in the DoD supply chain must demonstrate adherence to **NIST SP 800-171**. For European suppliers to giants like Lockheed Martin or Airbus, this means implementing 110 rigorous technical controls or facing disqualification.

### Our Defence & Aerospace Services:
- **CMMC 2.0 Level 2 Preparation:** Gap analysis, SSP (System Security Plan) development, and POA&M management.
- **DO-326A / ED-202A Implementation:** Specialised security assurance for aircraft airworthiness.
- **NATO STANAG Alignment:** Handling sensitive information according to Alliance standards.
- **NIS2 for Critical Defence Entities:** Meeting new EU requirements for supply chain resilience.

## RISK REFRAME:
