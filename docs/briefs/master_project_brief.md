# MASTER PROJECT BRIEF — ITIS SECURE WEBSITE BUILD

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
We are building a production-ready, enterprise-grade cybersecurity compliance website for **ITIS Secure**. The goal is to position ITIS Secure as the premier European umbrella compliance partner for companies in the Automotive and Defence & Aerospace sectors. The website will demonstrate that ITIS Secure takes clients from "Zero to Certified" by providing expert-led, end-to-end support for complex regulatory frameworks like TISAX, CMMC, and ISO 27001.

## 2. STRATEGIC POSITIONING
- **Brand position statement:** The definitive end-to-end compliance partner for Europe’s most regulated supply chains.
- **Unique value proposition:**
  - One partner for the entire compliance lifecycle (Assessment → Implementation → Certification).
  - Deep niche expertise in Automotive (TISAX) and Defence (CMMC/NATO).
  - Guaranteed audit readiness with a track record of 100% first-time pass rates.
- **Tagline options:**
  - "From Zero to Certified. One Partner. Full Compliance."
  - "Compliance Engineered for the Supply Chain Elite."
  - "The Shortcut to TISAX and CMMC Excellence."
- **What we are NOT:** We are not a generic IT consulting firm, we are not an accredited certification body (we prepare clients for them), and we are not a low-cost, automated-only compliance software tool. We are high-touch, expert-led specialists.

## 3. TARGET PERSONA PROFILES
- **Primary Persona:** *The Gated Supplier CISO* (e.g., Security Manager at a Tier-1 supplier).
  - **Goal:** Secure the next OEM contract by achieving TISAX AL3 or CMMC Level 2.
  - **Pain:** Facing strict deadlines, complex controls, and high stakes (losing millions in contracts).
- **Secondary Persona:** *The Quality Director / Managing Director* (SME Automotive/Aerospace).
  - **Goal:** Business continuity and expansion.
  - **Objection:** "Compliance is too expensive and slow."
- **Tertiary Persona:** *The Defence Programme Manager*.
  - **Goal:** Navigate DO-326A/CMMC requirements to participate in NATO/EU defence projects.

## 4. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE SUMMARY
- **Competitors:** Big 4 (too expensive/impersonal), Generic IT firms (lack specialized framework depth), Compliance Automation tools (lack the human "Implementation" layer).
- **Our Unfair Advantages:** founder Iulian Bozdoghina’s direct auditing experience, specialized focus on Automotive/Defence synergies, and the "Implementation Support" phase which competitors often skip.

## 5. WEBSITE ARCHITECTURE DECISION
- **Approved Sitemap (Phase 1):**
  - Home (Strategic Hub)
  - Services (TISAX, CMMC, ISO 27001, DO-326A, NIS2)
  - Industries (Automotive, Defence & Aerospace)
  - Resource Hub (Whitepapers, Checklists, Blog)
  - Tools (TISAX Readiness Quiz, Cost Calculator)
  - About/Company (Team, Credentials)
  - Contact (Lead Capture)
- **Phase 2:** Multi-region subdomains, Client Portal integration.

## 6. CONTENT TONE & VOICE GUIDELINES
- **Tone attributes:** Authoritative, Precise, Confident, Human, Results-focused.
- **Words to use always:** Compliance Journey, Audit Readiness, Framework Synergy, Strategic Security.
- **Words to never use:** Cutting-edge, Holistic (use "End-to-End"), Synergy (unless referring to frameworks), World-class (show, don't tell).
- **Reading level target:** Grade 11-12 (Professional/Technical).

## 7. AGENT TASK ASSIGNMENTS
- **Agent 02 (LEXIS):** Map the 0-to-Certified journey for TISAX and CMMC. Define service synergies.
- **Agent 03 (VIKTOR):** Draft the TISAX AL3 "90-day roadmap" content and BMW/VW supplier persona messaging.
- **Agent 04 (AEGIS):** Draft CMMC 2.0 and DO-326A compliance content for EU-based defence subcontractors.
- **Agent 05 (SIGNAL):** Map high-intent keywords like "TISAX consulting Romania" and "CMMC preparation Europe".
- **Agent 06 (MERIDIAN):** Write high-conversion copy for the "Zero to Certified" homepage model.
- **Agent 07 (FORMA):** Design a "Cybersecurity Command Center" aesthetic (Navy/Coral/Slate).
- **Agent 08 (CIPHER):** Implement Next.js 14 App Router and Framer Motion system-status widgets.
- **Agent 09 (NEXUS):** Build the Lead Scoring API and Sanity CMS schema for Case Studies.
- **Agent 10 (PRISM):** Specify the TISAX Readiness Quiz and Cost Calculator logic.
- **Agent 11 (SENTINEL):** Enforce 95+ Lighthouse Performance and WCAG AA compliance.

## 8. NON-NEGOTIABLES
- No OEM logos (text references only).
- Accuracy over fluff: Every claim must be defensible.
- Performance: <1s load time.
- Conversion: Every page must lead toward a "Gap Assessment" booking.

## 9. SUCCESS CRITERIA
- 100% Lighthouse score.
- 5+ qualified leads/month in first 90 days.
- Top 3 ranking for "TISAX consulting Romania" in 6 months.

## 10. RISK FLAGS
- **Risk:** Regulatory changes (e.g., CMMC delays). **Mitigation:** Agent 02 to monitor and update CMS content quarterly.
- **Risk:** Overly technical copy scaring off MDs. **Mitigation:** Agent 06 to balance technical depth with business ROI.
