# COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK BRIEF — AUTOMOTIVE & DEFENCE

## 1. APPLICABLE FRAMEWORKS

| Framework | Version | Mandatory/Optional | Who Requires It | Validity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TISAX** | 5.0 (VDA ISA) | Mandatory | BMW, VW, Mercedes, Tier-1s | 3 Years |
| **ISO 27001** | 2022 | Optional/Baseline | Global supply chain / ISO 9001 sync | 3 Years |
| **CMMC 2.0** | Level 2 | Mandatory | US DoD Contractors (inc. EU subs) | 3 Years |
| **NIST 800-171** | Rev 3 | Mandatory | Any org handling CUI (DoD/NASA) | Constant |
| **DO-326A** | ED-202A | Mandatory | Aerospace (EASA/FAA Type Cert) | Component Life |
| **NIS2** | EU 2022/2555 | Mandatory | EU Essential/Important Entities | On-going |

## 2. THE ITIS SECURE COMPLIANCE JOURNEY (Zero to Certified)

1. **Discovery & Scoping:** Define the assessment scope (locations, assets, data types).
2. **Gap Analysis:** Map existing controls against the target framework (e.g., VDA ISA 5.0).
3. **ISMS Implementation:** Build the Document Management System, policies, and technical controls.
4. **Expert Deployment:** Deploy on-site or remote experts to remediate specific technical gaps.
5. **Internal Audit (Pre-Cert):** Conduct a "mock audit" to ensure 0 major non-conformities.
6. **Support during Official Audit:** Represent the client during the ENX or C3PAO assessment.
7. **Continuous Compliance:** Annual health checks and framework updates.

## 3. SERVICE DEFINITIONS

- **TISAX® Readiness (AL2/AL3):** Complete preparation for the ENX assessment. Focus on Prototype Protection and Data Protection extensions. (Duration: 3-6 months).
- **CMMC 2.0 Roadmap:** Implementation of 110 NIST 800-171 practices for Tier-2 defence subcontractors. (Duration: 6-12 months).
- **ISO 21434 Automotive Cybersecurity:** Engineering-level compliance for vehicle type approval. Includes TARA (Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment).
- **DO-326A Airworthiness Security:** Airworthiness security process (ASPP) for avionics software/hardware.

## 4. FRAMEWORK SYNERGIES (The Multi-Compliance Advantage)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **TISAX + ISO 27001:** While TISAX is based on ISO 27001, it has specific automotive requirements. We build an Integrated Management System (IMS) that satisfies both with 80% overlapping effort.
> **CMMC + NIS2:** Companies complying with NIS2 in Europe can leverage those controls to meet ~60% of CMMC Level 2 requirements.

## 5. TECHNICAL CONTENT BLOCKS (For Website)

- **TISAX AL3:** "Requirement for sensitive information and prototype protection. Involves on-site audits and high-rigor physical security controls."
- **CMMC Level 2:** "Advanced protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Requires 100% adherence to 110 NIST practices with no POA&M allowed for certification."

## 6. COMMON CLIENT MISTAKES
1. **Scoping too small:** Leaving critical production sites out of TISAX scope, leading to OEM rejection.
2. **Lack of Evidence:** Having the policy but no logs or records of the policy being followed.
3. **Misunderstanding AL2 vs AL3:** Investing in AL3 when the OEM contract only requires AL2 (or vice versa).

## 7. ITIS SECURE DIFFERENTIATORS
- **Auditor Mindset:** We implement controls from the perspective of the people who will actually sign the certificate.
- **Human Implementation:** We don't just give you a "To-Do" list; we provide the engineers to DO it.

## 8. GLOSSARY
- **VDA ISA:** Association of the German Automotive Industry Information Security Assessment.
- **CUI:** Controlled Unclassified Information (Sensitive US Defence data).
- **ENX Portal:** The central platform where TISAX results are shared with OEMs.
